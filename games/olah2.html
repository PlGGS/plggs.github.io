                            Olah is the first real game that I ever created. It was also the first game in our Computer Science
                            class to make use of controllers of any kind. After asking our teacher for an extra night to work on
                            the project to figure out the few remaining bugs, we gave a live demo of our game for not only the
                            teacher to play, but for four of our classmates to play using wireless Xbox 360 controller. The reception
                            was incredible. Since we were the last group to present, our class spent the rest of the period having
                            different groups of students test out the game without a single crash! This was definitely the moment in
                            which I decided I wanted to pursue Computer Science as a career.
