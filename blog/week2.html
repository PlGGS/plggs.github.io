                    Note to self: Do not wait until the last day to begin homework for this class. It's not worth it. I just recently
                    developed a cold that kept me from doing a large amount of homework when I would've liked to. Additionally, I had
                    a literal 12 hour work day before beginning this assignment. But in reality, that's just the tip of the ice burg,
                    because this assignment was something else.
                    <br />

                    After a couple easy instructions, I found myself already messing up after just the third, as I forgot to push my
                    SELinkList class after completing that step. Yet, I somehow maintained a sense of composure, and after taking an
                    unreasonable amount of time to figure out how to rollback in order to recover my Player class, I felt fine adding
                    SELinkList onto the perforce server a little late. To be fair, it was already 3:00am after all. I kept thinking
                    about how easy the linked list functions would be with CSC 301 still fresh on my mind. Surely all of this couldn't
                    take me that much longer... It was almost 5:00am by the time I finished only the first of the two main linked list 
                    oriented functions in the player class.

                    Writing the Remove function proved to be so much more challenging than I had anticipated as well. I knew how to test 
                    for the four main cases, but for the life of me, I couldn't remember how to properly manipulate the list once I had hit 
                    them. It was still getting harder to focus as morning drew nearer, but I persisted, and eventually got the function 
                    working perfectly. At that point, it was already nearing 8:00am, but somehow, I managed to loop through the main three 
                    instructions of the final demo. It had been done. I sat dumbfounded for a few minutes taking in what I had just 
                    accomplished on three hours of sleep from the night prior, but I couldn't wait long. It was time to go write a blog.
