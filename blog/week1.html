                    When I first read through the assignment for homework 1 in class, I was extremely excited to breeze through 
                    the assignment, because I had written a much simpler algorithm in my senior year of high school that simply 
                    looped through the fibonacci sequence using two variables that would be summed on each iteration. 
                    To my surprise, after rereading the instructions Thursday night, I found that homework 1 asked for 
                    much more than I had previously anticipated.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Not only did homework 1 not require us to loop at all, it hit us with a logical conundrum that I had never 
                    even considered before this assignment. How does someone go about calculating a specific item in the fibonacci 
                    sequence without looping through all of the previous values? This logic puzzle instantly took me back to Discrete 
                    Math 2, in which, we discussed theorems like Binet's formula. Formulas like Binet's allow us to quickly answer 
                    mathematical inquiries pertaining to rediculously high values that would otherwise take an unreasonable amount 
                    of time to brute force.

                    <br />
                    After completing homework 1, I watch all of the videos provided for us covering how to use Preforce. Since I 
                    use GitHub often, Preforce was surprisingly painless and easy to understand and get started with. The hardest 
                    part for me was making 100% sure that I only had the necessary files in my project directory, because we were 
                    told very specifically what would happen if we were to turn in a project with auto-generated files in it. Once 
                    I figured out how to only submit the files I wanted, it was a breeze.
