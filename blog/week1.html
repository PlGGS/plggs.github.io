                    Background Control is an application I developed for my retro gaming TV. It allows for simple
                    volume and music controls through any Xbox 360 controllers that are currently connected. This
                    application was the first of mine to use a bitwise input manager and was the last step in the
                    creation of my retro gaming TV.
