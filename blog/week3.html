                    Sadly, this week has been a tough one. After getting extremely sick to the point where I had to leave the last class
                    period, I spent most of the weekend bedridden. Once I found the energy to get to work on this week's homework, I
                    felt terrible, as I then realized that I have a group to help out with that I didn't even know existed up until
                    that point! I quickly joined our group's groupchat on Discord and began piecing together what I had missed. The
                    only problem was, I hadn't missed much.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Our group hadn't said more than a few words to one another. No one seemed to know what was going on, and everyone
                    made it obvious that they didn't want to initiate anything. As this past week went by, my group members would check
                    in now and then to let us know that they had either started looking at the code or figured something out about the
                    assignment. Nothing was truly being discussed. It wasn't until the beginning of this week that our group began
                    communicating more effectively. We established our group leader, and began determining who would create the tests
                    for each of the many functions. As the pressure grew and the due date creeped closer, our group's attitudes' took
                    a stark turn for the better.

                    <br />
                    With one day till the first assignment was due, we had all finally agreed on more specific roles, and we all managed 
                    to select the functions that we each want to test for next week. With our decisions made, we finalized our site 
                    with an overview accordingly and each shared how we had gone about forming our sketches. Visual Studio's code map 
                    feature proved to be the way to go. With our roles chosen and our functions mapped, we're finally ready for the next 
                    class period whether we like it or not.
